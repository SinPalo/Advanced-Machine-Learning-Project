# Advanced-Machine-Learning-Project
Repository that holds the final project of the course

The repository consists of two files. Direct Learning and Transfer Learning, in each notebook it can be found the each learning process to make comparisions of the different models.
The data is directly downloaded from the API so there is no need to provide data. 

Most of the code was written by me with the help of ChatGPT in some sections, specially for fixing mistakes. As the code is based on the paper Risk of Transfer Learning and its Applications in Finance (2023) by Haoyang Cao, Haotian Gu, Xin Guo & Mathieu Rosenbaum, the code is highly inspired on pseudocode provided there.
